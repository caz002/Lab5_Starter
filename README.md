1. I would not a unit test to test the "message" feature because it is hard to use unit tests to measure how effective individual components interact with each other. For instance, one would have to test interactions betwee the writing and sending applications, which is hard to execute by only testing encapuslated units of code.
2. I would use a unit test to test the "max message length" feature of a messaging application, since it is a small-scale feature whose code can be encapsulated in units. The "max message length" code usually can be identified and isolated from other features, making it optimal to be debugged with unit testing.
